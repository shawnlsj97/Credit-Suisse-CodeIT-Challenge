These instruction are to help you solve a test challenge "Calculate Square". Instruction to this test challenge can be found at https://calculate-square.herokuapp.com/instructions

## Step by step
- Make sure you have node env setup on your local machine
- As per the instruction you have to implement a post endpoint `/square`
- Go to `app.js` in this template and you will find `/square` endpoint refers to implementation in `./routes/square` file
- Go to `square.js` in routes folder
- in this file a default post method in implemented (denoted by `/`). 
- write your implementation in this method. This method will be the entry point when you submit your solution for evaluation
- You need to follow similar approach for actual challenges. Define the end  point as per instruction for each challenge and then submit your application for evaluation
